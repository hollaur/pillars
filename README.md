#Pillars

These are the frontend code standards that are used by the whole Hanno team while working on projects. If a client has their own internal code standards in an existing product, these can, of course, override our own.

But in all other cases, we should stick to standards here, so thar we can get just a little closer to producing great code, all day long.

For more information about how we work together, check out our [Playbook](http://playbook.hanno.co/)!

##Credit

For the sake of standardisation and not inventing the wheel, Pillars are partially built upon elements borrowed from [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides), [GitHub](https://github.com/styleguide/css) and [Isobar](http://isobar-idev.github.io/code-standards/), updated and adapted in accordance with Hanno team's own preferences.
