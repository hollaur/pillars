Pillars
=======

These are the frontend code standards that are used by the whole Hanno team while working on projects. If a client has their own internal code standards in an existing product, these can, of course, override our own.

But in all other cases, we should stick to standards here, so thar we can get just a little closer to producing great code, all day long.

For more information about how we work together, check out our [Playbook](http://playbook.hanno.co/)!
