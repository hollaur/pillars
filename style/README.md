#Global Standards

Keep your code simple and DRY, optimise for readability and maintainability.


##General formatting rules

* Use soft-tabs with 4 spaces for indentation.
* Break long lines after 80 characters.
* Check for, and delete, trailing whitespace. [TrailingSpaces](https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces) plugin for Sublime Text is your best friend here.
* Avoid inline comments.
* Don't include spaces after opening brackets `(`, `[` or before closing brackets `]`, `)`.
* Don't misspell ;)


##Git

* Avoid merge commits by using a [rebase workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/workflow-walkthrough).
* Squash multiple trivial commits into a single commit.
* Write a [good commit message](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
