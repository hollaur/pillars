#CoffeeScript

* Avoid conditional modifiers (lines that end with conditionals).
* Initialize arrays using `[]`.
* Initialize empty objects and hashes using `{}`.
* Use hyphen-separated filenames, such as `coffee-script.coffee`.
* Use `PascalCase` for classes, `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions,
  `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants, `_single_leading_underscore` for
  private variables and functions.
* Prefer `==` and `!=` to `is` and `isnt`
* Prefer `||` and `&&` to `or` and `and`
* Prefer `!` over `not`
